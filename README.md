Slightly modified version of Paytab's Opencart 1.5x module.

The original was confusing to set up, language variables were missing and variables in the controller file were also missing. It was using text where it should have been using variables. For example: It asked for 'Merchant ID' and 'Secret' when it actually meant your Paytabs account email and password. Took me a few tries to figure that out.
